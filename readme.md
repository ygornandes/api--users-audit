# Users Audit API 

## Description

The User Audit project is an Api Rest that aims to meet the requirements proposed by the OnRising Test.
We used the Spring Boot framework for creating microservices and DDD for project architecture, and I decided to use them to speed up API development so that the main focus is on business rules and unit testing.

## Instructions for use

For build the application use the command below:

Linux: 
- ./gradlew clean build docker

Windows:
- gradlew.bat clean build docker

For run the API and switch on MongoDB and ActiveMq locally,  write the following command:

- docker-compose up -d 

For turn off the application use the command below:

- docker-compose down
